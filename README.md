# Interviews-preparation

This repository is my guide used to prepare me to general interviews and Software Engineering topics using Rust and Java programming languages but this content apply to any programming languages.

## Programming
All programming languages have a **common** word and concepts this is `programming`. When we're using any language like C++, Rust, Golang etc we're applying the common part(programming) + concepts and specific(language) in this section we'll to learn the common part

## Overview Languages

This section is useful to learn how choose the language to learn about it here depending of your case.

Exist a lot of languages and categories.
- Compiled or interpreted.
    - Build and compilation
    - Interpreter
- Statically or Dynamic Typed
- Secure or language without focus in security.

## Datastructures

## Algorithms and Patterns

## Testing

## Concurrency

## Languages
We will to put in practice all previews Computer Science concept with this languages

each lang folder is organized in the structure
- lang
- collections
- datastructures
- algorithms
- concurrency
