Ej. 
- primitive and non-primitive

### Primitives

- Boolean: is the what to manage on/off or true/false logic this type is really useful to control the flow of your programs

- Integers: is the way to store numbers exist several options to manage that only positive or positive and negative.

- floats: that is the way to store `3.87` numbers in this way you need identify your needed precision `3.8978973293`
- strings
- arrays

### Compounds
- array
- tuples
- struct/class

## Collections or Datastructures
- Vector - Arrays
- List
    - Linked
    - Double Linked
- Trees
- HashMap
